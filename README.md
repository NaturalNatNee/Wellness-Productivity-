## Inception Document: Wellness & Productivity App
Capstone Duration: 6 Weeks
Team Size: 
Team Members: 
Capstone Sponsor: Daniel De La Pena | ddelapena@uprighted.com

## 1. Project Overview
This capstone project involves developing a Wellness & Productivity App to help users optimize productivity and maintain well-being. The app will feature customizable work sessions, break timers, mood logging, and productivity insights. Given the team's size and experience level, the project is scoped to focus on core functionalities that are achievable within the timeframe.

## 2. Objectives
Build a Full-Stack MERN Application:
Gain hands-on experience with the MERN stack while focusing on practical and achievable goals.
Implement core functionalities such as authentication, data storage, and essential UI components.
Enhance Developer Skills:
Strengthen foundational knowledge in React, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js.
Promote Wellness & Productivity:
Equip users with tools to organize work sessions, take breaks, and reflect on productivity and well-being.

## 3. Core Features
  ### 3.1 Authentication
User Signup/Login: Secure user authentication with signup, login, and password management.
Protected Routes: Restrict access to productivity data and settings for authenticated users only.
  ### 3.2 Timer Functionality
Customizable Timer:
Users can set work sessions and break intervals based on their preferences.
Flexibility to choose work durations and break times.
  ### 3.3 Mood Logging & Insights
Mood Logging:
After each session, users can log their mood (e.g., happy, neutral, stressed).
Data stored to track emotional well-being.
Basic Data Visualization:
Charts showing productivity patterns over time (e.g., daily, weekly).
 ###  3.4 Dark Mode
User Preference:
Toggle between light and dark modes for a comfortable user experience.

## 4. Stretch Goals
  Preset Timer Settings:
Users can save and reuse customized timer presets (e.g.,50/10, 3 reps).
Basic Reminder Notifications:
Reminders for upcoming sessions or scheduled breaks.
Basic Insights:
Simple insights on most productive times (e.g., morning vs. afternoon) without advanced analytics.
Sound Notifications:
Optional sound alerts for session start and end.
OAuth 2.0 for Google Sign-In:
Allow users to sign up and log in using their Google account for a smoother authentication experience.

## 5. Scope & Limitations
Scope
Focus on building core functionalities while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
Prioritize user authentication, timer customization, mood logging, and dark mode.
Limitations
Advanced analytics, calendar integrations, and PWA functionality are out of scope.
