# Wellness-Productivity-
This repository is for practicing fullstack web development

## Inception Document: Wellness & Productivity App
Capstone Duration: 6 Weeks
- Team Size: 5
- Team Members: Nat (TL) Alex L, Trenton, Jose, Robbie
- Capstone Sponsor: Daniel De La Pena | ddelapena@uprighted.com

## 1. Project Overview
This capstone project involves developing a Wellness & Productivity App to help users optimize productivity and maintain well-being. The app will feature customizable work sessions, break timers, mood logging, and productivity insights. Given the team's size and experience level, the project is scoped to focus on core functionalities that are achievable within the timeframe.

## 2. Objectives
1. Build a Full-Stack MERN Application:
    - Gain hands-on experience with the MERN stack while focusing on practical and achievable goals.
    - Implement core functionalities such as authentication, data storage, and essential UI components.
2. Enhance Developer Skills:
    - Strengthen foundational knowledge in React, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js.
3. Promote Wellness & Productivity:
    - Equip users with tools to organize work sessions, take breaks, and reflect on productivity and well-being.

## 3. Core Features
  ### 3.1 Authentication
- Protected Routes: Restrict access to productivity data and settings for authenticated users only. Log in first, then prompt users to sign-up.
- User Signup/Login: Secure user authentication with signup, login, and password management. Users only have access to thier own Data
  ### 3.2 Timer Functionality
Preferences (some flexibility)
- Users can set work sessions and break intervals based on their preferences.
- User can set the duration of the session times ( 1 specific time) in min/hrs
- User can set duration of breaks (1 specific time) in min/hrs.
- User can set amount of breaks. 
- Expand pause feature (when cl stops session early)
Customizable Timer
- Timer counts down or up from specified duration amount
- During a break a delightful message is shown
- Timer stops at the end of a session
- Sessions are logged to a persistence layer with time of day

  ### 3.3 Mood Logging & Insights
Mood Logging:
- After each session, users can log their mood (e.g., happy, neutral, stressed).
- Data stored to track emotional well-being.
Basic Data Visualization:
- Charts showing productivity patterns over time (e.g., daily, weekly).
      - Charts will show session title, length, breaks, mood, time of day session.
 ###  3.4 Dark Mode
User Preference:
Toggle between light and dark modes for a comfortable user experience.

## 4. Stretch Goals (Icebox/Optional) 
- Preset Timer Settings:
  - Users can save and reuse customized timer presets (e.g.,50/10, 3 reps).
- Basic Reminder Notifications:
  - Reminders for upcoming sessions or scheduled breaks.
- Basic Insights:
  - Simple insights on most productive times (e.g., morning vs. afternoon) without advanced analytics.
- Sound Notifications:
  - Optional sound alerts for session start and end.
- OAuth 2.0 for Google Sign-In:
  - Allow users to sign up and log in using their Google account for a smoother authentication experience.

## 5. Scope & Limitations
### Scope
- Focus on building core functionalities while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Prioritize user authentication, timer customization, mood logging, and dark mode.
### Limitations
- Advanced analytics, calendar integrations, and PWA functionality are out of scope.
